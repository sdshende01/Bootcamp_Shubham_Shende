# Nifty50 Index Mutual Fund Performance Predictor

## Project Scoping  
Retail Individual Investors (RIIs) in India often invest in Nifty50 index mutual funds as a relatively safe, market-linked wealth-building option. However, they lack tools to evaluate and forecast potential returns based on historical performance.  

This project aims to provide RIIs with an interpretable, data-driven way to understand trends and likely future performance of Nifty50 index mutual funds.

**Primary Stakeholder:** Retail Individual Investors (RIIs).  

### Goals
- Build a simple predictive model for Nifty50 index mutual fund performance.  
- Provide RIIs with insights into short-term expected returns (1–3 months).  
- Deliver outputs in an interpretable format (notebook + visuals).  

### Lifecycle
1. **Data Collection**: Gather NAV data of Nifty50 index mutual funds + benchmark Nifty50 index data.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess missing values, align dates, normalize.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze return patterns, volatility, and fund vs. index correlation.  
4. **Modeling**: Implement baseline predictive models .  
5. **Evaluation**: Measure accuracy.  
6. **Delivery**: Provide predictive notebook, memo, and stakeholder visuals.  

### Deliverables
 `/data/` → Raw and cleaned NAV + Nifty50 datasets.  
 `/src/` → Scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.  
 `/notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for Data Analysis and modeling experiments.  
 `/docs/` → Stakeholder memo .  
 `README.md` → Project overview, goals, lifecycle, deliverables.
